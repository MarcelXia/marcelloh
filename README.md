### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![<GO>](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=GO&logoColor=34abd9)
Do you know I like to program in GO?
  
I am a GO trainer, a GO Lead Developer and a Senior Software Architect.

ðŸ’¬ Stuff that I promote:
- the KISS principle (Keep It Stupid Simple)
- think first, code later
- clean architecture
- TDD

âš¡ Fun fact:
I don't know how to do any other profession
